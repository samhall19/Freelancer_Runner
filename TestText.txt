1. Looks like there's a heatwave coming in
2. I should have brought more sun cream
3. Is it me or is it getting hot around here?
4. Need to find some shade!
4. It's so hot that I just saw a chicken lay a fried egg
5. It's so hot that I burned my house down just to cool it off
6. It's so hot I just saw a bird pull a worm out of the ground with an oven mitt
7. I could really use an ice cream
8. If only there was a bottle of water around here
9. Maybe running in a heatwave isnt a good idea
10. Feelin' hot hot hot
